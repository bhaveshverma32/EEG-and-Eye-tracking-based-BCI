## Overview
This research focuses on the development of a hybrid Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) that utilizes both EEG (Electroencephalogram) and Eye Tracking for enhanced web access. The proposed approach offers an affordable and user-friendly alternative to traditional BCI systems, which are often complex and require specialized equipment.

## Key Features

### EEG Classification
The study emphasizes sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) of the brain elicited by motor imagery (MI) tasks.

### Surface Tracking
Utilizes AprilTag, a visual fiducial system, to track the edges of the device screen, enhancing accuracy.

## Results & Findings
The research found that subjects who underwent BCI training performed better than those who didn't. This suggests that regular training can improve both user performance and the BCI system's efficiency.
